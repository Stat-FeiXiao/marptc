# qifptc
An R package for fitting marginal promotion time cure model using the methods of generalized estimating equations and quadratic inference functions.
## Two main R functions are included:
* Fit marginal promotion time cure model with generalized estimating equations using **geeptc()**
* Fit marginal promotion time cure model with generalized estimating equations improved by quadratic inference functions using **qifptc()**
